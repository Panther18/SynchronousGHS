 System Name- 71924
 Lab Name- Open CS LAB 1
 Compiler- JRE 1.7_60

Files Enclosed-
	1. Sources files-
		a. FloodMax.java
		b. Master.java
		c. Process.java
	2. FloodMax.jar
	3. ReadMe.txt
	4. Input - output
		a. SampleInput_8_Process - SampleOutput_8_Process
		b. SampleInput_3_Process - SampleOutput_3_Process

How to run the program?
	1. Unzip the file
	2. Invoke Command prompt
	3. Set the path to locate the file unzipped
	4. Run the following command (without quotes)-
		" java -jar FloodMax.jar "
 
Other details-
  How to give an Input?
	1. Enter the number of processes
	2. Enter an unique ID for each process (All ID's should be integers except 0)
	3. If there is a connection between any two processes, enter 1, Else enter 0
	   (Note- This will take care of the symmetry of the processes connected assuming all the links are bi-directional)
	4. A caution is generated to display for any isolated processes, you can re-enter the connections for those particular nodes
	
  How to read the Output?
	1. Each process (in the order of input) will print their parent ID and their corresponding children processes ID
	2. The root of the tree will print "ROOT" in place of parent ID
	3. An isolated note will identify itself as a root with it being the only process in it's tree
	
  Assumptions-
	1. A process with the largest ID will become the root of the tree
